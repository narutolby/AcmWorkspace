Question 1 / 5 (Problem A)
Given a rational number expressed as A/B where A and B are integers, find the position of Mth occurrence of digit D (0-9) after decimal point. For example 3/7 = 0.4285714285... (A=3, B=7), so the 2nd (M=2) 4 (D=4) is the 7th digit after decimal point.

Limits:

0 < A, B, M < 2 x 108

0 <= D <= 9

Input:

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, N. N test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing 4 numbers, A, B, M and D separated by spaces.

Output:

Each line contains the position (starting from 1) of the specified digit D. Output “0” if it is impossible to find the digit.

Question 2 / 5
Given a N*N grid where N is an even number and 6 points A, B, C, D, E and F. The coordinates of each point are (xa, ya), (xb, yb), ..., (xf, yf). Define S to be the following.

S = 2 * (SABC + SDEF) where SABC and SDEF are the area of the triangle ABC and DEF.

Below is an example of 4*4 grid. In this case S = 2 * SABC + 2 * SDEF = 6 + 8 = 14.



Now your task is, given an arbitrary S, find one possible solution of the 6 points that meets the above requirement.

Limits:

xa, ya, xb, yb, ..., xf, yf are integers between 0 and N.
N and S are natural numbers.
0 < N, S < 1010
Input:

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, N. N test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing 2 numbers, N and S separated by one space.

Output:

The coordinates of A, B, C, D, E and F. If no possible solution can be found, output the word “impossible” (quotes for clarity).

Sample:

Question 3 / 5 (Problem C)
You are given N line segments, with each line segment depicted by its starting and ending points, calculate the longest continuous line segment with the given line segments set.

Limits:

1 < N < 100
​The starting and ending point integer ranges from 0 to 10,000
Input:

The first line of the input is the number of line segments N, each following line has two integers depicting the starting and ending points, respectively.

Output:

Length of longest consecutive line segment.

Sample:

Input	Output
5
0  1
0  5
7  10
8  12
1  3

5
With the given input set, the longest continuous line segment starts at 0 and ends at 5 (or starts at 7 and ends at 12), gives the length 5.

Test case: (Please write a program to read the test case input data below from STDIN and print the output to STDOUT in the format as described above)

Question 4 / 5
Given a source M*N matrix A and a target M*N matrix B, elements in each matrix are integers of range 0 ~ (M*N-1), each integer only appears once in the same matrix. Please find the steps to change matrix A to B. The rules are:

Only “0” can switch with neighbor element. A neighbor element is the one that is to the left/right/top/bottom of “0”.

Certain values in matrix A cannot be changed, they are designated in array C.

Input:

First line is M, N separated by space, followed by M lines of elements in matrix A, then followed by M lines of elements in matrix B, then followed by a line of elements in array C. Values in each line are separated by spaces.

Output:

One line with X steps, separated by space. Each step is the value of element that would switch with “0”.

Sample:

 

For A= [	0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8	], B= [	3 1 2 
6 4 5
0 7 8	], C=[1]

Question 5 / 5
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sentence, whose meaning may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction.

Some well-known English palindromes are, "Able was I ere I saw Elba", "A man, a plan, a canal Panama!",  "Madam, I'm Adam" or "Madam in Eden, I'm Adam", "Doc, note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod" and "Never odd or even".

You are given a list of words, please use those words to find out the longest palindrome, with as many characters as you can.

Notes:

The sentence need not to be logically meaningful nor grammatically correct, it can be any combination of the words;

Palindrom's are case insensitive, e.g. letter 'E' is considered same as letter 'e';

You can only use the words in the given list;

Each word can be used at most once;

Word list may contain 1~100000 words.

Input:

First line is the number of the words in the list, then followed by the list of words, with one word in each line.

Output:

Just output any of the longest sentence you found. If the given list can’t construct a valid palindrome sentence, just output “impossible”.

Sample:

Input	 Output
5
ate
Lisa
Bonet
basil
no	
Lisa Bonet ate no basil

 

Sample 2:

Input	 Output
